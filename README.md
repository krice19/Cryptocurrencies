# Cryptocurrencies

## Summary 

This assignment will analyze cryptocurrencies data and discover how they could be grouped to create a classification system.  I will first process the data to fit machine leaning model.   Then I will use the unsupervised learning technique of K means clustering to group the cryptocurrencies.  I will use unsuperevised learning since there is no known output we are looking for.  My clustering analysis will be used to display finding on the cryptocurrencies by graphing visualizations.
